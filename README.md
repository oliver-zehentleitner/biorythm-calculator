## Biorythm Calculator for My Grandfather
My grandfather has been researching biorhythms for over 60 years and has been using the 
[Santron Biolator](https://www.metatechnisches-kabinett.de/rechner/santron/santron-biolator) (also known as the Casio 
Biolator) for decades.

Since calculations beyond December 31, 1999, can only be performed with a workaround and my grandfather has been 
experiencing a high rate of wear and tear on these devices - which have become increasingly difficult to find - I 
developed this calculator as a modern replacement.

## Purpose
The goal is to provide a reliable substitute for the Biolator that can calculate biorhythms and display the remaining 
days as whole numbers instead of percentages.

## Why HTML and JavaScript?
By using only HTML and JavaScript, the calculator is implemented as a 
"[WebApp](https://oliver-zehentleitner.github.io/biorythm-calculator)" that can be hosted on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/oliver-zehentleitner/biorythm-calculator). This 
ensures it is accessible on all devices without requiring installation or updates. At the same time, it is very easy to 
make the project available as an Android or IOS app with WebView.
