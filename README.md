## Biorythm Calculator for My Grandfather
My grandfather has been researching biorhythms for over 60 years and has been using the 
[Santron Biolator](https://www.metatechnisches-kabinett.de/rechner/santron/santron-biolator) (also known as the Casio 
Biolator) for decades.

Since calculations beyond December 31, 1999, can only be performed with a workaround and my grandfather has been 
experiencing a high rate of wear and tear on these devices - which have become increasingly difficult to find - I 
developed this calculator as a modern replacement.

## Purpose
The goal is to provide a reliable substitute for the Biolator that can calculate biorhythms and display the remaining 
days as whole numbers instead of percentages.

## Why HTML and JavaScript?
By using only HTML and JavaScript, the calculator is implemented as a 
"[WebApp](https://oliver-zehentleitner.github.io/biorythm-calculator)" that can be hosted on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/oliver-zehentleitner/biorythm-calculator). This 
ensures it is accessible on all devices without requiring installation or updates.
